# al-pinist
Al-Pinist was envisioned as a wall-climbing robot inspired by VertiGo – A Wall-Climbing Robot Including Ground-Wall Transition by Disney Research. The goal was to create this cool device. 

While the final prototype was far from the sophistication of the original research project, the journey provided extensive hands on experience in prototyping, hardware integration, embedded systems, and control logic implementation.

A significant portion of the firmware and control architecture was influenced by Joop Brokking’s Project YMFC-32 – The STM32 Quadcopter, which served as a foundation for understanding flight control systems, sensor fusion, and low-level microcontroller programming.
